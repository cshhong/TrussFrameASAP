# TrussFrameASAP: User-Playable Version

This repository provides a user-playable version of TrussFrameASAP, designed to create and test a Reinforcement Learning (RL) environment. In this environment, modular structural frames are sequentially built and analyzed using a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) tool ASAP, which is implemented in Julia. The overarching project aims to train an RL agent that can interactively design and optimize frame structures in terms of constructability and structural performance.
